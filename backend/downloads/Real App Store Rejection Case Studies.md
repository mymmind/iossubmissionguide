## Key Takeaways

1. **Documentation is critical**: Developers who documented their process had higher appeal success rates

2. **Reviewer education helps**: Many rejections were reversed simply by explaining features clearly

3. **Test accounts matter**: Huge number of rejections due to reviewers not being able to test features

4. **Persistence pays off**: Most indie developers succeeded after 2-3 rejections with proper responses

5. **Policy changes are sudden**: Apple can change rules overnight (AppGratis, Bitcoin apps)

6. **Public attention works**: For famous apps/developers, media coverage accelerated resolution

7. **Technical explanations win**: Detailed technical responses more effective than emotional appeals

8. **Crashes are immediate rejection**: Zero tolerance for crashes during review

9. **Privacy is non-negotiable**: Any privacy policy ambiguity = rejection

10. **Different reviewers = different standards**: Consistency is a major issue in review process
