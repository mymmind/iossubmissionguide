## Key Insights from Research

### Apple Developer Forums Discovery:
Research confirmed that **external links ARE allowed** on Apple Developer Forums. The platform whitelists specific domains (stackoverflow.com, github.com, etc.), and the configuration shows links are permitted. This opens up opportunities previously thought restricted.

**Strategy adjustment:** Can participate in Apple Forums more actively than initially expected, though should still be conservative compared to Stack Overflow.

### Platform Culture Differences:
- **Stack Overflow:** Strict, technical, value code examples
- **Reddit:** Friendly, community-driven, hates spam
- **Quora:** Professional, long-form, SEO-focused
- **Apple Forums:** Official, conservative, solution-oriented
- **Dev.to:** Tutorial-focused, cross-promotion friendly
- **Indie Hackers:** Story-driven, entrepreneurial, authentic

**Strategy adjustment:** Customize tone and format for each platform (templates provided).

### High-Value Question Types:
Research shows these question types get asked WEEKLY:
1. "How to submit [React Native/Flutter] to iOS?" (multiple per week)
2. "App rejected for Guideline 2.1" (daily on Stack Overflow)
3. "How long does review take?" (evergreen, high search volume)
4. "What are screenshot sizes?" (frequent, easy to answer)

**Strategy adjustment:** Focus monitoring on these high-volume question types for quick wins.

## Conclusion

This Q&A platform strategy provides a sustainable, value-first approach to building App Store Pass's authority in the developer community while driving qualified traffic and backlinks.

**Core philosophy:** Be genuinely helpful first, promote second.

**Execution:** Start small (1 answer/day), build credibility, scale gradually.

**Timeline:** 6 months to establish authority, ongoing maintenance 3.5 hrs/week.

**Expected outcome:** Recognized as the go-to App Store resource that other developers cite and recommend.
