### 1. Stack Overflow

**Opportunity Level: HIGH**

**Key Tags to Monitor:**
- `app-store-rejection` - Direct match for our content
- `app-store-connect` - Process and submission issues

**Community Guidelines:**
- Self-promotion is allowed if you disclose affiliation
- Links must add value beyond what's in your answer

**High-Value Question Types:**
1. "App rejected for Guideline X.X - how do I fix?"
2. "How to submit React Native/Flutter app to App Store?"
3. "App Store Connect errors/issues"
4. "In-App Purchase implementation questions"
5. "Privacy policy and GDPR compliance for App Store"
6. "App crashes during review (Guideline 2.1)"
7. "Minimum functionality rejection (Guideline 4.2)"

9. "Screenshot requirements and sizes"

**Strategy:**
- Answer 3-5 questions per week consistently
- Provide detailed, code-level solutions
- Link to specific guides when relevant (not homepage)
- Build reputation organically (answer questions without links too)
